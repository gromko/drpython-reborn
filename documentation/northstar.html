<p><a href="http://www.northstarteens.org">North Star</a> is a center for
self-directed learners. Kids who choose not to go to school and pursue their
own studies come here to learn about an impressive variety of topics. Classes
are offered in diverse subjects such as:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>philosophy</li>
  <li>rhetoric</li>
  <li>number theory</li>
  <li>physics</li>
  <li>programming</li>
  <li>history</li>
  <li>tidal pool biology</li>
  <li>crochet</li>
  <li>Shakespeare</li>
  <li>war and peace</li>
  <li>music ensemble</li>
  <li>theater</li>
  <li>botany</li>
  <li>disability and the media</li>
  <li>supreme court cases</li>
  <li>business</li>
  <li>photography</li>
  <li>writing</li>
  <li>art</li>
  <li>and more!</li>
</ul>

<p>
The school is small, with one full time teacher/staff member, a private army
of college volunteers, and a host of passionate students.
</p>

<p>
If you, dear user, would take a moment to think of the children, those plucky
little folks, and donate some tax-deductable moolah to a truly wonderful cause,
you can help a cutting edge "un-school" survive, and make what was hell for
most of us (high school and middle school) heaven for these kids (and
eventually more by serving as a model).
