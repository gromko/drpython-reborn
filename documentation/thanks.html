<h1>Thank You</h1>
<center><img src="montypythonMOLDoctor.jpg" align="middle" border="0"></center>

<p>
To all the programmers/artists whose works have made this project possible.
</p>

<p>
To my Dad and my high school programming teacher for helping
inspire a skill which has served me well in my current activities.
</p>

<p>
Thank you to my students at North Star. If not for you, I never would have
thought of teaching programming, and never would have written this program.
</p>

<p>
Thanks to Robert Tate, for helping debug throughout the creation of 1.0.0.
</p>

<p>
Thank you to the users of this program.
</p>

<p>
Thanks to the supporters of this programmer, and of North Star. Your donations
are greatly appreciated.
</p>

<p>
And thanks to Monty Python for inspiration (and being chill about me using
their images.) As additional thanks, I exhort you to spend some quality time
watching Monty Python's Flying Circus and their many quality films.
</p>

<p>
One more:
</p>

<p>
Thanks to the Open Source Community, and the advocates of Free Software and
Open Source.
</p>

<p>
If not for you, I would not even have been able to afford a computer, let alone
create this program.
